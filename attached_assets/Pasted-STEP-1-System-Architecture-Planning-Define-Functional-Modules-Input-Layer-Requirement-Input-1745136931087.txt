STEP 1: System Architecture & Planning
üîß Define Functional Modules:
Input Layer:

Requirement Input UI

Code Upload & Parsing

Blueprint Upload

Processing Layer:

CAD/BIM File Parser

NLP-based Code Analyzer

MEP Rule Engine + AI Designer

Output Layer:

AutoCAD/BIM Generation

Simulation & Validation

Feedback UI

üõ† Tools You'll Likely Use:
Programming: Python (backend), React (frontend), FastAPI/Flask (API)

AI/ML: TensorFlow or PyTorch, OpenAI API for NLP

CAD/BIM Integration: Autodesk Forge, Revit API, IFC parser

Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (for spatial data), MongoDB (optional for metadata)

üì• STEP 2: Build the Input Interfaces
1. Requirement Input UI
Web form or chatbot-style input:

Number of rooms, bathrooms, floors

HVAC preferences

Electrical needs

Plumbing fixtures

Target building codes (city/region)

2. Building Code Upload & Parsing
Accept building codes (PDF, DOCX, web link)

Use:

PyMuPDF, pdfplumber for PDF text extraction

spaCy or OpenAI for semantic parsing

Chunk code into rules (stored in a DB)

3. Architectural Blueprint Upload
Upload .dwg, .dxf, .rvt, or .ifc files

Use:

ezdxf for DWG/DXF parsing

IfcOpenShell for IFC parsing

Autodesk Forge viewer (optional)

üìä STEP 3: Convert Blueprint to Spatial Data
Extract:

Room boundaries, sizes

Wall locations

Door/window placements

Floor levels

Utility riser shafts

Store layout in a graph or grid model

You‚Äôll represent the building as a navigable graph where MEP paths can be routed.

‚öôÔ∏è STEP 4: Build the AI-Based MEP Design Engine
1. Rule Engine (based on building codes)
Encode codes like:

Max length for plumbing pipe

Minimum air flow per square foot

Circuit loads and wire gauge rules

Use: JSON rule set + rule engine (Drools or custom Python)

2. Routing & Placement AI
Pathfinding: A* or Dijkstra for duct/pipe/wire routing

Optimization: Reinforcement Learning or Genetic Algorithm to minimize cost/space

Heuristics: Space clearance, avoid structural beams, allow for future maintenance

3. Design Each MEP System
Mechanical: HVAC sizing (use ASHRAE data), ductwork routing

Electrical: Load calculation, cable tray layout, breaker distribution

Plumbing: Pipe sizing, pressure zones, waste stack design

üìê STEP 5: Output to CAD/BIM Format
Generate:

2D plans (DWG/DXF)

BIM components (IFC/RVT)

Tools:

pyautocad or AutoLISP for AutoCAD output

Revit API for BIM model editing

Use Autodesk Forge for cloud rendering

üß™ STEP 6: Validation and Simulation
Tools:

EnergyPlus/OpenStudio (HVAC simulation)

ETAP or DIgSILENT (electrical simulation, optional)

Internal simulation for pipe pressure/drop

Run checks:

All codes followed?

No cross-over of systems?

Pressure/load within limits?

üîÑ STEP 7: User Feedback Loop
Display AI-generated design in a web viewer (e.g., Forge Viewer, Three.js)
